# Anthill Simulation

Welcome to the Anthill Simulation! This project aims to simulate the behavior of ants as they search for food and navigate their environment. Watch as the ants explore, find food, and create trails of pheromones to guide their fellow ants.

## Usage
To play the Anthill Simulation, follow these steps:

* Open the built executable or run the project within the Unity editor.
* You will be instantly transported into an anthill environment, teeming with ants.
* Utilize your mouse to interact with the game:
  - Left-click and drag to draw new parts of the map, such as walls or obstacles.
  - Hold the shift key while left-click dragging to erase walls or obstacles.
  - Scroll the mouse wheel to resize the brush for drawing or erasing.
* Observe the ants as they dynamically explore the environment, diligently search for food, and create pheromone trails to guide their colony.
* Immerse yourself in the fascinating world of ants as you watch their behaviors and strategies unfold.
* Use the Settings object to customize various parameters of the simulation, tailoring the experience to your preferences.
* Enjoy the experience of exploring the intricate world of an anthill, where cooperation, communication, and survival intertwine.

## Interaction
The Anthill Simulation allows you to interact with the simulation in the following ways:

* Drawing: Left-click and drag to draw new parts of the map. Create walls or modify the environment to challenge the ants' navigation. Hold the shift key while left-click dragging to erase previously drawn walls or obstacles.
* Observation: Watch as the ants move, explore, search for food, and create pheromone trails. Observe their behavior and adaptability.
* Settings: Customize the simulation by adjusting parameters in the Settings object. Experiment with ant movement speed, pheromone strength, and other behavioral aspects.

## Ants Behavior
The ants in the simulation exhibit the following behaviors:

* Exploration: Initially, the ants disperse throughout the environment, exploring and searching for food sources.
* Food Search: The ants can detect the presence of food nearby. Once they find food, they pick it up and start their journey back to the anthill.
* Pheromone Trails: The ants leave trails of pheromones while moving, which guide other ants towards the food source and back to the anthill. Blue pheromones indicate the path when leaving home, while red pheromones signify the path when returning from food.
* Pheromone Strength: The strength of the pheromones decreases over time. Freshly laid pheromones are more potent and attract more ants. Fading pheromones signal that the path may no longer lead to food.

## Simulation Controls
The Anthill Simulation provides the following controls:

* Draw Mode: Enter draw mode to create walls or modify the environment. Left-click and drag to draw new parts of the map. Hold the shift key while left-click dragging to erase walls or obstacles.
* Simulation Speed: Adjust the simulation speed to observe the ants' behavior at different rates. Slow down for detailed analysis or speed up for an overall view.
* Settings: Customize various parameters of the simulation using the Settings object. Modify ant movement speed, pheromone strength, and other behavioral aspects.
